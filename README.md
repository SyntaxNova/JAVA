<h1> SPPU SE IT / CS OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOP) ASSIGNMENTS (2019 PATTERN)</h1>
<a href="https://github.com/SyntaxNova/OOPS_JAVA/blob/master/Complex1/src/Atharva/Complex1.java"><b>Complex Number</b></a> : <p>Design a class ‘Complex ‘with data members for real and imaginary part. Provide default and
Parameterized constructors. Write a program to perform arithmetic operations of two complex
numbers.</p>
<br>
<a href="https://github.com/SyntaxNova/OOPS_JAVA/blob/master/Publications/src/Atharva/Publication.java"><b>Publications (Polymorphism)</b></a> : <p>Identify commonalities and differences between Publication, Book and Magazine classes. Title,
Price, Copies are common instance variables and saleCopy is common method. The differences
are, Bookclass has author and orderCopies(). Magazine Class has methods orderQty, Current issue,
receiveissue().Write a program to find how many copies of the given books are ordered and
display total sale of publication.</p>
<br>
<b>Inheritance</b> : <p>Design and develop inheritance for a given case study, identify objects and relationships and
implement inheritance wherever applicable. Employee class hasEmp_name, Emp_id, Address,Mail_id, and Mobile_noas members. Inherit the classes: Programmer, Team Lead, Assistant Project
Manager and Project Manager from employee class. Add Basic Pay (BP) as the member of all the
inherited classes with 97% of BP as DA, 10 % of BP as HRA, 12% of BP as PF, 0.1% of BP for staff
club fund. Generate pay slips for the employees with their gross and net salary.</p>
<br>
<a href = "https://github.com/SyntaxNova/OOPS_JAVA/blob/master/DynamicB/src/Atharva/shape.java"><b>Dynamic Binding</b></a> : <p>Design a base class shape with two double type values and member functions to input the data
and compute_area() for calculating area of shape. Derive two classes: triangle and rectangle. Make
compute_area() as abstract function and redefine this function in the derived class to suit their
requirements. Write a program that accepts dimensions of triangle/rectangle and display
calculated area. Implement dynamic binding for given case study.</p>
<br>
<a href = "https://github.com/SyntaxNova/OOPS_JAVA/blob/master/Interface1/src/a/vehicle.java"><b>Interface</b></a> : <p>Design and develop a context for given case study and implement an interface for Vehicles
Consider the example of vehicles like bicycle, car and bike. All Vehicles have common
functionalities such as Gear Change, Speed up and apply breaks. Make an interface and put all
these common functionalities. Bicycle, Bike, Car classes should be implemented for all these
functionalities in their own class in their own way.</p>
<br>
<a href="https://github.com/SyntaxNova/OOPS_JAVA/blob/master/ExceptionH/src/Atharva/Exception.java"><b>Exception handling</b></a> : <p>Implement a program to handle Arithmetic exception, Array Index Out of Bounds. The user enters
two numbers Num1 and Num2. The division of Num1 and Num2 is displayed. If Num1 and Num2
are not integers, the program would throw a Number Format Exception. If Num2 were zero, the
program would throw an Arithmetic Exception. Display the exception.</p>
<br>
<a href= "https://github.com/SyntaxNova/OOPS_JAVA/blob/master/Template/src/atharva/ElementCounter.java"><b>Template</b></a> : <p>Implement a generic program using any collection class to count the number of elements in a
collection that have a specific property such as even numbers, odd number, prime number and
palindromes.</p>
<br>
<b>File Handling</b> : <p>Implement a program for maintaining a database of student records using Files.
Student has Student_id,name, Roll_no, Class, marks and address. Display the data for few
students.
Create Database
Display Database
Delete Records
Update Record
Search Record</p>
